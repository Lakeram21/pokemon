# Overview
This Software takes a Pokemon dataset in form of a CSV file and parse it.
It allows a user to compare different Pokemon against each other with their individual Stats.
It will use Pandas and Matplot lib to present graphs to represent the data so that user can make easy comparison.

 This is where you can access the same[Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon).

My purpose of doing this piece of software was to explore Pandas and Matplotlib framework within Python.
I wanted to do simple parsing of data and creat simple Graps of those data.

# Data Analysis Results

1. How do the Pokemon differ from each other in terms of Defence, Attack, speed?- Depending on the Graph that You render, it can be assumed.

2. Do their difference in stats depends on their Type and if so how much?- They vary in type, some pokemon are stronger than other Types while weeker than others.

# Development Environment

1. Vs code
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib

# Future Work


* Integrate a another Dataset with real world data.
* Use Django to present the Data - currently doing.
* Make the Charts/graphs animated.
